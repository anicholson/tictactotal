# tic-tac-total

> A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.

## Goal
The aim of this little project is to implement tic-tac-toe in a bunch of languages that can compile to Javascript. Each implementation should:

1. Be idiomatic to that language
2. Compile/Transpile to JS
3. Behave the same way as the other implementations
4. Provide tests, if that language (easily) provides testing infrastructure in the <lang> -> JS process.

## Languages Supported

| Source Language | Compiler/Transpiler | Tests? |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| [Ruby][1]       | [Opal][2]           | No     |
